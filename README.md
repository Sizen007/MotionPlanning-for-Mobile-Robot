# MotionPlanning-for-Mobile-Robot

Through this project, I learned the basic knowledge of motion planning systematically. The project includes seven parts and each part includes theoretical study and practical operations. This project includes three main parts: Front-end Path finding, Back-end trajectory generation and MDP&MPC applications. 

For the operating system, it is mainly based on the Matlab and ROS/C++. Below, I will introduce three parts separately.
